                Foreign exchange or Forex is one of the largest and most liquid
                markets with over 5 trillion dollars traded daily. A trader can
                trade currencies against each other and based on the changing
                values of currencies over time he can make a profit or a loss.

                demand and are affected by geopolitical and economic events
